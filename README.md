Rollbar Java
=============

This is the notifier library for integrating Java apps with [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com/), the error aggregation service. You will need a Rollbar account: sign up for an account [here](https://rollbar.com/signup/).

This differs from the main fork in that it was made simpler with less magic.  Specifically the threading has been removed so that invocations in this block during the requests (allowing threading to be handled at another later if needed).  In addition the dependency with Log4j has been removed so that this appears as a pure library.

The API has been changed, but primarily for style reasons.  For example `RollbarAttributeProvider` provides an interface so that you know exactly what can be transmitted to rollbar (extending `RollbarAttributeAdapter` and override the functions which you wish to specify values for).

Feel free to file issues for feature expansions or questions around this library.

Usage
------------------------------

Example:

	RollbarNotifier notifier = new RollbarNotifier(url, apiKey, env);
	
	try {
		doSomethingThatThrowAnException();
	} catch(Throwable throwable) {
		notifier.notify(throwable);
	}

The RollbarNotifier object has several static methods that can be used to notify:
* notify(message)
* notify(message, RollbarAttributeProvider)
* notify(level, message)
* notify(level, message, RollbarAttributeProvider)
* notify(throwable)
* notify(throwable, RollbarAttributeProvider)
* notify(message, throwable)
* notify(message, throwable, RollbarAttributeProvider)
* notify(level, throwable)
* notify(level, throwable, context)
* notify(level, message, throwable, context)


The parameters are:
* Message: String to notify 
* Throwable: Throwable to notify
* RollbarAttributeProvider: An interface, with a default implementation of "RollbarAttributeAdapter".  Methods can be overriden to provide details you wish to be included in the notification.
* Level: Notification level (don't confuse with the Log4j level). By default a throwable notification will be notified with a "error" level and a message notification as a "info" level.

RollbarAttributeProvider
------------------------------

The rollbar notifier use RollbarAttributeProvider to add additional information to the notification and help to solve any detected problem.  To understand the notification message and the possible values see the [rollbar API item] (https://rollbar.com/docs/api_items/).

The best way to use this is to extend "RollbarAttributeProvider" and override methods for information that you wish to provide in the notification.  To understand what possible pieces of information can be provided, checkout the [RollbarAttributeProvider interface] (https://github.com/fullcontact/rollbarNotifier/blob/master/src/main/java/com/muantech/rollbar/java/RollbarAttributeProvider.java).
